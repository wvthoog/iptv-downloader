<h2>Info</h2>
Wrote this little script to combine widevine_keys with XstreamDL-CLI to download IPTV content with a handy terminal menu

More info can be found at my [website](https://wvthoog.nl/capture-iptv-content/) 

<h3>First run: </h3>

```
cd iptv-downloader
python3 -m venv venv
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python downloader.py
```
